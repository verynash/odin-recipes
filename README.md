# odin-recipes
first project simple recipe website

This website will link to a few recipes and will be a way to practice basic page creation, lists (ordered and unordered), and common html tags with best practices. It should mostly be used as a way to cement some foundations, which I have already done a bit of in the past with the ZJC Custom Kicks website. 

It will not be pretty.
